                The employee said that at TCS, he was earning a little less than ₹15 lakh per annum.

“I started in service based companies. I worked hard. But the growth was slow… Most of the time it felt like I was only doing calls and tickets. One day I decided I want something better. So I started preparing for product based interviews,”
